# Comprehensive analysis of pseudogene expression in human and macaque brains

In this study, we aim to explore whether pseudogenes, traditionally considered as a group of non-functional remnants of protein-coding genes, could possess putative biological relevance in the brain. To that end, we propose three primary objectives: (i) characterizing the tissue- and brain region-specificity of pseudogene expression; (ii) identifying temporally dynamic (TD) pseudogenes across diverse brain regions; and (iii) identifying differentially expressed pseudogenes associated with psychiatric disorders.

The expression data of the pseudogenes and protein-coding genes in human and macaque quantified based on the computational framework in this study were deposited to [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.16810204).
